# Programming Exercise 7-4
#
# Program to calculate simple statistics for 20 user-supplied numbers.
# This program prompts the user for 20 values,
# assigns them to a list, then finds the sum, min and max values,
# and displays the results.



# define the main function

    # define a constant to number of inputs and set it to 20
    

    # declare number list as an empty list


    # declare float variables for high, low, total, average, current


    # declare a string variable for user input


    # loop to gather inputs (use the number of inputs constant)
    
        # prompt the user for a number

        # use a function to ensure the user input can be cast to a float

        # add the current value to the list

    # assign the high (max), low (min), and total (sum) from the number list

    # calculate the average using total and the number of inputs constant

    # display the results, formatting floats to two decimal places



# function to ensure user input can be cast to a float



# Call the main function to start the program
