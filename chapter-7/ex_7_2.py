# Programming Exercise 7-2
#
# Program to display a list of random integers.
# This program takes no input,
# it loops through a list of integers and exchanges them for random integers,
# then displays the list on a single line.



# to use the random functions, import the random module



# Define the main function

    # Initialize a list of integers.


    # loop through the list

         # assigning a random integer to each member of the list

    # loop through the list


        # display the current value

        
        # add a comma and space, unless this is the last value



# Call the main function.
