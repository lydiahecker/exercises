# Programming Exercise 7-3
#
# Program to compute simple statistics for one year of monthly rainfall.
# This program prompts the user for 12 monthly rainfall values,
# calculates the total and average, finds the high and low values,
# and displays the results on the screen.



# define the main function

    
    # define local float variables for total, average, high and low rainfall

    
    # define local string values for high month, low month and rainfall input


    # define a list of floats to hold 12 monthly rainfall amounts

    
    # define a list for month names initialized with names for all 12 months.


    # loop through the monthly rainfall list

        # prompt the user for rainfall input, using the month name in the prompt

        # use a function to make sure rainfall input can be cast to a float

        # assign rainfall input value to the current item in monthly rainfall list


    # Calculate the total of monthly rainfall
    
    # Calculate the average monthly rainfall
    
    # find the high (max) rainfall

    # use the index of the high rainfall to find the month name for high rainfall

    # find the low (min) rainfall

    # use the index of the low rainfall to find the month name for low rainfall

    # Display results appropriately, formatting float values to two decimal places



# function to validate float input



# Call the main function.
