# Programming Exercise 7-6
#
# Program to create list of values taken from another list, based on a comparison.
# This program takes no input,
# it uses a comparison value that it compares to a predefined list,
#   adding values larger than the comparison value to a new list,
# then displays the results.



# define the main function

    # Define a constant for comparison number (5)
    
    # define a  comparison list of values (1 to 10)

    # declare result list as an empty list

   
    # Call the function to compare for larger values and assign the result
    # to new list, passing comparison number and comparison list as arguments.


    # Display the comparison number.

    # Display the comparison list on a single line

    # Display the new list on a single list



# Function to return a list of integers larger than a comparison value from a list.
# This function accepts a comparison value and a comparison list as parameters,
# compares each value to the comparison value, and if larger adds it to a new list,
# then returns the new list of integers to the calling function.

    # Declare result list as an empty list.
 

    # Loop through the values in the comparison list.
        
        # if the current value is greater than the comparison value
            
            # append the value to the return list.
 
    # return the return list.
 
        

# Call the main function to start the program
