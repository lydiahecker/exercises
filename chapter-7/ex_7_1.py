# Programming Exercise 7-1
#
# Program to Total a week's sales (seven inputs).
# This program prompts a user for a sales amount for each day of the week,
# totals them up, then displays the total formatted as currency.



# Define the main function

    # Define local float variable for rtotal sales


    # Initialize lists for daily sales and days of the week (7 elements each)

    # loop 7 times

        # get the daily sales for the current day by name
        # use a function to validate the input can be cast to a float

        # add the daily sales to the total


    # Display total sales; use a $ and format the value to two decimal places



# Include a function to ensure the program has valid float values



# Call the main function to start the program
main()
